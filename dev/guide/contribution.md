Before your contribution, here's some rules that needs to adhere.

## Commit and Pull Request Format

### [eweOS/packages](https://github.com/eweOS/packages)

```
[<pkgname>] <pkgver>: <brief description>

<optional long description>
```

Brief description should start in lowercase (if applicable).

For example, when upgrading `dummypkg`:

```
[dummypkg] 0.1.0-2: remove some patches

Upstream merged and fixed: https://github.com/...
```

Adding a new package:

```
[newpkg] 1.0.0-1: initial packaging
```

## Members

(This is an early draft and execution may vary accordingly while we remain small)

To apply for new member, you need to be:

- at least contributed to the eweOS development: new packages, bug fixes, wiki entries, etc., and
- at least sponsorships from at least two of the existing members, and
- more than 2/3 of the current members voting in favour of your joining

If you are rejected by some members during the sponsorship process, please mention it in further discussions asking for sponsorship.

Members remain their positions unless:

- they decide to leave eweOS voluntarily, or
- half of the current members voting against one's membership, or
- they don't show activity (PRs, issues, wikis) on the project for 6 months.
